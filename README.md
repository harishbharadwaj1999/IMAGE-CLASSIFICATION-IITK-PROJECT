# Image-Classification-IITK-Project
This project is part of kaggle competition of classifying images.
In this project I have tested 3 deep learning models based from the academia.
I have tailored them to better suite the problem in hand and also generated more/normalized the dataset for some models to be trained.
Experiment 1 is on VGG16 model.
Experiment 2 is on Resnet model.
Experiment 3 is on VGG19 model with pre-trained weights.
